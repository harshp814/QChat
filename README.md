<a href="http://www.qchat.online/" target="_blank">QChat</a> is an anonymous Q and A app. 
<p>
The purpose of our project is to allow students who are nervous to ask questions in large lecture rooms to have a voice through an anonymous platform by providing a cross platform Q and A app. The app will allow users to anonymously post questions. Users will be able to upvote questions they would like to find the answers to and the most popular questions will be showed at the top for the professor to answer.
